# MusicGeneration
Generating music using LSTM reccurent neural network:

## Process
The idea is to feed network with pop songs and let her learn the note/chord prediction based on k(parameter) last notes/chords. 
Then network prediction will be combined with domain-specific heuristics made up by professionals to generate authentic song based on seed(couple of notes/chords in specific key)
